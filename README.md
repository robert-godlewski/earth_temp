# Description
This is a graph of the Global Temperature Average Anomaly per month since 1850 to show the change of global temperature.

Temperature anomaly referes to prior temperatures based off of a long-term average.  Positive anomalies indicates warmer temperatures and negative anomalies indicates cooler temperatures based off of the long term average.
