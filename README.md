# Description
This is a graph of the Global Temperature Average Anomaly per month since 1850 to show the change of global temperature.

Temperature anomaly referes to prior temperatures based off of a long-term average.  Positive anomalies indicates warmer temperatures and negative anomalies indicates cooler temperatures based off of the long term average.

**Data Link**: Can use the [NOAA website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/1/0/1850-2024) to grab the data reports of temperature anomaly changes for each month since 1850 in Celsius.
